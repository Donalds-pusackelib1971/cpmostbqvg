OMG just walked out of Back in Action and my mind's like gsfldf 🤯. Okay so the theater was like 𝘧𝘳𝘦𝘦zing and my back, ugh, it's gonna be stuck in   chair pose forever, swear. Anyway, the  , right? Holy moly guys, what a comeback!!! My popcorn spilled everywhere when that giant explosion happened - like booooom 🧨 and everyone was cheering and my drink was like about to yeet itself onto the floor. Totally my vibe 😅. 

So the lead dude, or what was his name??? Jesse? or Jake? had this face like a confused potato in a rainstorm but omg, there's this scene, the motorcycle chase. Wild! Like 𝘸𝘢𝘵𝘤𝘩𝘪𝘯𝘨 your laundry spin but wayyyyy cooler. Somehow he jumps from a bridge, seriously WTH? I swear my brain couldn't even process it. Had to, like, hand-in-front-of-the-mouth-gasp. I'm telling ya, if you don't 𝘥𝘰𝘸𝘯𝘭𝘰𝘢𝘥 the   after this, you're missing out. 

> The villain tho, man, was like a 90s cartoon bad guy, such a cliché 😂 but it worked?? I dunno, maybe 'cause the theater was so packed and people were so into it, it felt like a rollercoaster but also a smoothie... if that makes any sense?? The noise level was through the roof, couldn't even hear my own thoughts at some points. Actually, I'm still kinda NOT hearing 'em LOL. 

And the soundtrack!!! Oh, the beats just BAM BAM right in your bones. Can't even compare. Maybe if an octopus played drums while on skates, that's how unpredictably awesome it was.  

Oh, and someone just texted me like 'should I 𝘸𝘢𝘵𝘤𝘩 the  ?' and I'm like DUH! I mean, despite the popcorn incident, totally worth it. Get on it before spoilers hit the fan like a banana slip in a noir   or somethin'.
